# Rectangles App


## My solution for recruitment task 


I created a React App that creates rectangles and saves their layout. 

The requested feature set was:


* add a new "rectangle" to the area
* remove a rectangle
* resize a rectangle using direct mouse manipulations
* move a rectangle using direct mouse manipulations
* change the color of a rectangle
* clear the area
* save the current area layout (the position, size, and color of each rectangle in the area)
* name a saved layout
* return to a saved layout
* delete a saved layout from the set of saved layouts

This was one of my first React Apps, I manage to implement almost all of requested features.


[Demo App](https://izabelka.github.io/rectangles/)



## How to set up the app:
1. Clone the repository
2. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. On your console run: `npm install`
4. Install react: `npm install --save react react-dom`
5. Start server: `npm start`


If it does not work you should remove `node_modules` catalog and repeat process from 3rd step.
