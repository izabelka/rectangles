# Rectangles App


## My solution for recruitment task 


I created a React App that creates rectangles and saves their layout. 

The requested feature set was:
*add a new "rectangle" to the area
*remove a rectangle
*resize a rectangle using direct mouse manipulations
*move a rectangle using direct mouse manipulations
*change the color of a rectangle
*clear the area
*save the current area layout (the position, size, and color of each rectangle in the area)
*name a saved layout
*return to a saved layout
*delete a saved layout from the set of saved layouts

This was one of my first React Apps, I manage to implement almost all of requested features.
